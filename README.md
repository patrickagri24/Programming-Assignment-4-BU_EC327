# Programming-Assignment-4-BU_EC327
These files consist of my Programming Assignment 4 in EC327.  This C++ program builds off of Programming Assignment 3, and includes
exception handling to make gameplay cleaner.  In addition, storage of game objects are changed from arrays to linked lists to make it so
multiple astronauts and other game objects can be created.  An alien class is also created which can "kill" alien objects, adding a new
dimension to how the user plays the game.
